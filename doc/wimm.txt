                         What is WIMM?
                         -------------


WIMM (short for "Where Is My Mail") is a personal mail scanner
for Squish. It is designed to be used together with the Squish
echomail processor made by Scott Dudley.

It will read your Squish configuration file (Squish.cfg) and
scan all echomail areas listed (or all areas found in a
'echotoss.log' file), for mail addressed to you. When it finds
a personal message it will move or copy the message to another
area, or make a list of all messages found and post that list
in a message.

WIMM can be useful in several ways. Maybe you are just as
curious as I am, and want to know if there is personal mail as
soon as possible, without having to read all messages.
Or maybe there's so much mail on your system, that you can't
ever read it all.. Or maybe you just want to keep your
personal messages in a seperate area...

                      ------------------
                      How do you run it?
                      ------------------


That's easy! Just edit WIMM.CFG and type WIMM. 


                      ------------------
                      WIMM.CFG reference
                      ------------------

WIMM.CFG is the default name of the configuration file. The
configuration file may contain comments. On a comment line the
first non-space character should be a semi-column ';'.
Example:

; This is a comment line..

If a line is not a comment, it should contain a keyword.
Keywords are not case sensitive, so "Name" is interpreted the
same as "name" or "NaME".
Every keyword is followed by a 'value':

<keyword>     <value>

like:

Name          "Gerard van.Essen"
Mode          List
etc.


            --------------------------------------
            Keywords in WIMM's configuration file.
            --------------------------------------


SquishCfg
---------

This keyword tells WIMM where to look for the Squish
configuration file. Specify both path and name here.

Example:

SquishCfg      C:\Squish\Squish.cfg 


Name
----

This tells WIMM what names to look for in the TO: field of the
messages. You can supply as many names as you like. Please put
double quotes around the names. The name search is not case-
sensitive, so "Joe SysOp" will have the same effect as "joe
sysop".

Example:

Name           "Gerard van Essen" 
Name           "gerard van.essen" 
Name           "Art"


WimmArea
---------

This is the location of the area where WIMM should list, move
or copy the personal messages. This must be a LOCAL area, not
netmail or echomail!

Example:

WimmArea     D:\Local\Personal


WimmType
---------

This is the type of the WimmArea. This can be either "Squish"
or "*.MSG".

Example:

WimmType    Squish


Mode
----

This tells WIMM what to do with the personal messages. This
can be:  

- LIST:    WIMM will post a message with a list of all
           personal messages. It will also give you the
           current message number. Note, hoewever, that due
           to Squish' "dynamic renumbering" feature, this
           number is not necessarily correct (anymore).

- COPY:    WIMM will copy all personal messages to WimmArea.

- MOVE:    WIMM will move all personal messages to WimmArea.

Example:

Mode List 


MarkReceived
------------

This tells WIMM if the personal messages that are found should
be marked "received". If WIMM finds a personal message that
has the "received" flag set, it will skip that message. So, if
you set this to "Yes", personal messages will only be moved,
copied or listed once. (For 'move' this is quite redundant ;-)
This can be either Yes or No.

Example:

MarkReceived Yes


ScanFrom
--------

This keyword changes which messages are scanned by WIMM. If
this is set to "LastRead", WIMM will scan the messages AFTER
the lastread pointer in each area. 
The lastread pointer will be taken from a file called
"lastread" (for *.msg areas) or from the appropriate *.SQL
file (Squish areas, the first lastread pointer from that file
is used).

Note for GoldED users: if "Scanfrom Lastread" doesn't seem to
work, check out the GoldED documentation for the SQUISHUSERNO
keyword. WIMM's 'Lastread' feature will work with SQUISHUSERNO
set to 0.
GoldED sometimes seems to do complicated things with a
USER.BBS file and lastread-file offsets, even in a single user
environment without a BBS (!).

If "Lastread" is set to "All", WIMM will ignore the lastread
pointer and always scan all messages. (If you use this, it's
probably wise to set MarkReceived to "Yes").
So, this can be either "LastRead" or "All".

Example:

ScanFrom LastRead


EchoArea
--------

This declares an extra area to be scanned. The format is the
same as the EchoArea keyword in Squish.CFG.

Default behaviour:

*    By default, WIMM will not scan the Netmail area. 
*    The 'Dupes' area is always skipped (unless you
     specifically 'Force' it). 
*    The Bad_Msgs is scanned, it is treated like a normal
     echomail area.

So, if you would like WIMM to scan the netmail area (or any
other area not listed in your Squish configuration file) as
well, you should declare it manually in WIMM.CFG.

Example:

EchoArea  Netmail   C:\Bink\Netmail -$


Attributes
----------

With 'Attributes' you can specify the attributes that should
be placed on a moved, copied or 'list' message in the
WimmArea. The original message will not be changed, except for
possibly adding the 'received' status (if 'Markreceived' is
set to 'Yes').
For the message in the WIMMarea, WIMM will clear the
attributes, and add the ones you specify with the 'Attributes'
keyword.

Options:

P - Private
S - Sent
C - Scanned
L - Local

Example:

Attributes      SCP


Log
---

The Log statement will let WIMM log the scanned areas,
personal messages and errors in logfile. If no log is
specified, there will be no logfile. Please specify full path
and filename.

Example:

Log C:\Squish\Wimm.log


Exclude
-------

With EXCLUDE you can prevent areas from being scanned. You can
specify 1 area for every exclude line. Use the areatag to
specify the echo.

Example: 

Exclude MUFFIN

This will prevent MUFFIN from being scanned.


There is also very limited wildcard support. You can use '*'
as a wildcard. It can _only_ be the first or the last
character!

Examples: 

Exclude *028

This will prevent all areas with a tag ending with 028 (like
points.028, basic.028 etc) from being scanned.

Exclude BASI*

This will exclude areas starting with BASI (like BASIC,
BASIC.028..). 

You can have as many 'Exclude' statements as you like.


Force 
-----

With FORCE you can have WIMM scan a certain area on every run.
This is useful when using the -F command line switch, for
example if you want the netmail area to be scanned (the
netmail area will _never_ appear in an echotoss.log file!).
You can have as many 'Force' statements as you like.

Force has the same wildcard support as Exclude.

Example:

Force Netmail


Notes
-----

'NOTES No' will prevent WIMM from putting a 

'--> Note: Copied by...'  

message at the top of every moved or copied message.
This is useful if you use WIMM to move netmail for Areafix and
Raid etc. from a large, fast Squish netmail area to a nearly
empty  *.MSG area.. (so areafix and raid run much faster).
This can be either 'Yes' or 'No'.


Example:

Notes Yes


AddAreaKludge
-------------

This keyword controls whether WIMM will add an 'AREA:' kludge
to moved or copied messages. TimEd and GoldED can use this
kludge to easily find the correct area to put a reply in
(using the 'reply in another area' function).

This can be either 'Yes' or 'No'.

Example:

AddAreaKludge Yes




                    ----------------------
                    Command line switches.
                    ----------------------

There are two command line switches that can be used for WIMM:

-C : This gives path and name of an alternative configuration
     file. The default configuration file is WIMM.CFG in the
     current directory. 

Example:

WIMM -Cc:\dl\mycfg.cfg

This uses c:\dl\mycfg.cfg as configuration file.


-F : This gives the path and name of a "echotoss.log" file.
     The areatags from this file will be read, and only the
     corresponding areas will be scanned for personal
     messages.

Example:

WIMM -Fc:\squish\echotoss.log

In this case the file c:\squish\echotoss.log will be used.


Of course, you can also use both switches together, like:

WIMM -Cmycfg.cfg -Fc:\squish\echotoss.log



                    -----------------------
                    Some 'technical' stuff.
                    -----------------------

WIMM was written using Borland C++ v3.1 (DOS version),
although the '++' extensions were not used. The OS/2 version
was compiled using Watcom C/C++ v10.0a.

The program relies heavily on the Squish MSGAPI by Scott
Dudley.
The MSGAPI is very easy to use, and as a result even a novice
programmer (I'm still not very experienced..) can make useful
programs (I hope ;-).

In Squish areas WIMM tries to read the indexes directly (so it
does NOT use the MsgApi there..!). WIMM gains a lot of speed
by doing this (instead of physically reading all message
headers or opening the area the 'standard' way using the
MSGAPI).
Usually this doesn't make any difference (except for the
speed), but there is one exception: in areas that are in fact
empty, but _did_ contain messages in the past, it is possible
that WIMM is a bit confused and says there are in fact
messages scanned in that area. 
This hardly ever happens, and will not cause WIMM to
malfunction (i.e.: miss any personal messages). If it bothers
you, use WIMM 1.00, and miss out on the extra speed :-)
(Or just delete the .SQI file for that area. If the area
doesn't contain any messages, that won't be a problem).

Apart from that you might miss personal messages if your
indexes are 'corrupt'.

                            -------

Thanks to...

*    ROn van der Nagel (2:500/133) and some of his points for
     betatesting.

*    Lawrence Pit for betatesting.

*    Don Dawson (my sales manager for the USA and Canada :-),
     somehow he always manages to find loads of bugs..

*    Scott Dudley for Squish, Maximus, Msgapi..

*    Everyone who sent me netmail about WIMM. A nice 'thank
     you' netmail from 'far away' can really make my day!
     It's only because of some enthusiastic netmails that I
     decided to work on a new version of WIMM (yep, Don
     Dawson again, and also quite a few others!)
